# Licenta 4D CT-Scan

#Description
A python app that will allow the medical team to see the 3D computation of all the CT Scans of a person as well as data gathered from them (statistics based on the volume, size and shape). It will parse all the CT Scans that a person have done and gather info as well as plotting a 3D image through time based on the number of CT Scans that a person have done.

*Note*: This will be connected via an App to make it easier to see/access everything.
