# To-Do List for U-Net Model Training and Nodule Visualization

To train the U-Net model on the LUNA16 dataset and visualize the detected lung nodules in 3D, you will need to perform the following steps:

## 1. Preprocess the LUNA16 dataset
* Download the LUNA16 dataset from https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/.
* Convert the raw data to a more usable format using the SimpleITK library.
* Resample the 3D CT scans to a consistent voxel size (e.g., 1x1x1 mm).
* Normalize the voxel intensities (HU values) to a specific range (e.g., -1000 to 400).
* Segment the lung regions using thresholding and morphological operations.
* Extract patches from the CT scans for training the U-Net model (e.g., 64x64x64 voxel patches). Make sure to include positive (with nodules) and negative (without nodules) samples.

## 2. Train the U-Net model
* Split the dataset into training and validation sets (e.g., 80% for training and 20% for validation).
* Modify the U-Net model to accept 3D inputs by changing the Conv2D and Conv2DTranspose layers to Conv3D and Conv3DTranspose, respectively.
* Compile the model using an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam) and loss function (e.g., binary_crossentropy for binary segmentation).
* Train the model on the preprocessed dataset for a certain number of epochs and monitor the validation loss to avoid overfitting. Use data augmentation techniques if necessary.

## 3. Make predictions using the trained model
* Load a trained U-Net model and make predictions on new CT scans. The output will be a probability map indicating the likelihood of each voxel belonging to a lung nodule.

## 4. Post-process the predictions to obtain 3D visualizations and nodule data
* Threshold the probability maps to obtain binary segmentation masks (e.g., a threshold of 0.5).
* Apply morphological operations (e.g., opening) to remove noise and small false-positive detections.
* Use connected component analysis (e.g., skimage.measure.label) to identify individual nodules.
* Visualize the detected nodules in 3D using a library like Mayavi or plotly.
